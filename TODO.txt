Galaxy2D - TODO list
========================================

 - Overworld map thing like SMB3+
 - some method of keeping track of player progress
 - Proper inventory
 - Level creation workflow
 - Enemy AI
    - rename AISimple to AIRolling
        determine how this affects player
        does it just get in the way?
        does it explode on contact?
        does it hide when near and emit spikes?
    - Flying : follow path (copy from floating platforms)
    - Roaming : seek out player
    - other stuff
 - tighten movement
